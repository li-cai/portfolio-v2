                <p>Welcome! :)</p>
                <p>I'm Cailin Li, a third year student at Rochester Institute of Technology studying Software Engineering and New Media Interactive Development. I enjoy programming as well as designing and developing interactive interfaces. As a Software Engineer, I hope to be able to solve complex problems through the development of software.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am looking for a Software Development Co-op or Internship through which I can challenge myself, gain new skills, and learn more about the Software Engineering industry.</p>

                        <img src="images/toolshare01.jpg" class="screenshot" />
                        <p>ToolShare is a web-based system for facilitating the sharing of tools within communities. I worked on this project as a part of a team of five Software Engineering majors in the Introduction to Software Engineering course. Our ToolShare system supports many features such as user registration, tool registration, tool reservation, messaging, and communities for sharing called ShareZones.</p>
                        <p>ToolShare was developed with <strong>Django</strong> using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>SQLite</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong> for version control. In addition, we used <strong>BootStrap</strong> to assist with the responsive design of our system. The system was built after going through a software development cycle of requirements analysis, modeling, construction, testing, and deployment for two releases of the product. We also wrote comprehensive documentation for our system including the initial plan with a milestone schedule, the requirements spreadsheet with user stories and priority assessments, the design document with <strong>UML</strong> diagrams, and the test plan tracker. My team had weekly meetings and managed our tasks and sprints via <strong>Trello</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Through working on this project, I worked with full stack development in <strong>Django</strong> and gained experience working with a <strong>MVC</strong> framework. In addition, I wrote numerous unit tests, participated in a formal code review, went through cross-team beta testing, and conducted acceptance tests.</p>

                        <p>For this project, I created a Generic Puzzle Solver written in <strong>Java</strong> which uses the <strong>BFS algorithm</strong> to solve puzzles in the fewest number of steps. The Chess Solitaire puzzle (pictured above) has a <strong>Swing</strong> GUI.</p>
                        <p>The focus of this project was object-oriented programming, inheritance, and separation of concerns using MVC. A generic puzzle interface and solver was implemented to work with three different types of puzzles. The Chess Solitaire puzzle has a Swing GUI that creates a game board from a text file and allows the user to interactive with the GUI to solve the puzzle. The user also has the option to reset to the original configuration or advance to the next step of the optimal solution by clicking "Hint".</p>

                        <p>Fablefruit is the concept for a game meant for a web application or a mobile device. For this project, I used <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> to create a vertical and horizontal splash page as well as a Point of Sale poster for the game.</p>
                        <p>Fablefruit is a game in which you can nurture and grow your collection of fruits so they can turn into Fablefruits. In the design of the splash page and the Point of Sale poster, my goal was to convey the mystical quality of a Fablefruit through the use of a simple color palette enhanced by gradients and transparencies.</p>

                        <p>Using <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, I designed and created a new 404 Page for the RIT website that complies with RIT's corporate identity manual.</p> 
                        <p>The goal of this project was to create a 404 page that is visually interesting, functional, and user-friendly using the 960 grid. I was inspired by the 960 grid and the metro-themed tiles of Windows 8. To create visual interest, I incorporated the tiger, the RIT mascot, to contrast its fluidity to the rigidness of the tiles. Also, this page notifies the user of the error that occurred and provides options to navigate to Home or back to the previous page.</p>
